How could i take this readme file and convert it into an obsidian workframe. i have obsidian set up and working but I do no have any working experience with it. I plan to use this project to set up an obsidian page to go along with the application I am going to be writing. later I might want to find a way to automate the process where I take a class with docstrings and automatically generate the folder structures to merge with my original vault. I want you to tell me now what you understand about the prompt then I will give you the readme file.

Here's my understanding:

1. **Obsidian for Documentation**: You want to use Obsidian as a knowledge base or documentation platform for an application you're developing, starting by converting the content from a README file into an Obsidian structure.

2. **Project Setup in Obsidian**: Since you’re new to Obsidian, you're looking for guidance on setting up a framework to organize the README content, potentially involving folders, notes, and linking capabilities.

3. **Automation Goal**: Later, you’re interested in automating the generation of this structure. Specifically, you want to use Python class docstrings to create Obsidian-compatible folder structures and content that syncs seamlessly with your original vault.

If this is accurate, feel free to send over the README file. I can help suggest the best structure in Obsidian and lay out steps for possible automation when you’re ready.

I posted the instrucctions.md file in to chat gpt.

Thank you for providing the README content. Here’s how I see it integrating into an Obsidian framework:

1. **Structure in Obsidian**:
   - Break down the assignment into **separate, navigable pages** within Obsidian, using Obsidian’s folder system to group concepts, instructions, requirements, and glossary terms.
   - Each section (e.g., “Terminology,” “Requirements,” “Instructions”) can be a folder or a note within a larger folder for the whole assignment.

2. **Note-by-Note Breakdown**:
   - Create individual notes for **key terms and definitions** in the "Terminology" section. This will allow linking between terms, and you can cross-reference definitions like "AutoML" or "Pipeline" with more specific requirements in other notes.
   - Use separate notes for each part of the assignment (Parts 0, I, II, III), placing them under relevant folders such as "Core Library" or "Streamlit App."

3. **Linking & Tagging for Easy Reference**:
   - Use links within notes (e.g., a link to "Metric" within requirements for implementing metrics) to cross-reference between definitions and specific requirements.
   - Tag notes or terms (e.g., #classification, #metrics) to help you quickly locate sections related to specific concepts, especially as the complexity of the project grows.

4. **Automation for Later**:
   - You’re interested in automating docstring-based folder generation, which would involve parsing classes and methods from your code and creating corresponding notes.
   - Once you have a working Obsidian structure, I can help outline the steps for building a script that extracts class names, docstrings, and attributes, and generates structured notes or folders in Obsidian’s format.

With this layout in mind, let’s look at breaking down each section more granularly or linking them if there are further interdependencies you want highlighted.
